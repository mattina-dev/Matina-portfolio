# Matina Safaei’s Portfolio

Hi there 👋  
I’m **Matina Safaei** — a frontend developer with 3 years of experience working in Vue.js, TypeScript & JavaScript, passionate about UI/UX, and actively building toward a Product Manager role.

This portfolio is my sandbox and showcase: where I build real projects, experiment with interactions, and document my growth — both in code quality and user experience.

---

## 🎯 What You’ll Find Here

- A curated selection of my frontend projects that demonstrate:
  - Vue.js + TypeScript architecture and best practices  
  - UI/UX-driven design (I care about how things *feel*)  
  - Animation & interaction polish  
- Evidence of my upward journey into product thinking: how I ask “why”, not just “how”.
- Links to my resume, LinkedIn, and design assets where relevant.

## 🛠 Tech Stack + Tools

- **Frontend**: Vue.js, Nuxt.js, TypeScript, Vuetify  
- **Animations / UX polish**: lenis (or scroll-animation libs), CSS transitions & transforms  
- **Design & Planning**: Figma, Notion (my task hub)  
- **Version control & build tools**: Git, Vite, npm, etc.
